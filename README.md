# Vision-detect-and-track
## 1. Descripci√≥n
The main  objective of this repository is to provide a set of computer vision tools to detect and track objects depending on their characteristics, but it was designed particularly to identify a soccer ball inside a soccer field. OpenCV in ROS was used to develop the algorithms. The tools implemented in the repository are:
* Kalman Filter + LBP Cascade
* Particle Filter + Color Detection
* Kalman Filter + Blob Color Detection
* SURF
* Dynamixel Servomotors Motion
