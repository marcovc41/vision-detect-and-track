The main  objective of this repository is to provide a set of computer vision tools to detect and track objects and to educate beginners about the emerging technologies that are used in robotic applications.  These systems where developed using the Robotic Operating System and the Open Source Computer Vision library for C++11. It is important to remark that this package was particularly designed to identify a soccer ball inside a soccer field. The tools implemented in the repository are:

## 3. Installation
#### Installation Guide

Once the requirements have been met and the [catkin workspace](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment) have been set up, the next step is to clone and build this repository typing the following commands in a new terminal:
```bash
cd catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/marcovc41/vision-detect-and-track.git
cd ..
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```
Depending on how you set your workspace, `catkin build` may be used instead of `catkin_make`.

If all the steps where successfully completed,  no errors should appear after building the code. Note: A dynamixel library error would appear if you haven't installed dynamixel library yet. If you are not interested in using dynamixel motors, please errase the corresponding lines that refer to the track program in the package CMakeLists (`vision_tools/CMakeLists.txt`) and also the text "dynamixel_sdk" that appears inside "find_package" function, then build your workspace again and the problem should be fixed.

Before running the nodes, some modifications to the code are needed due to the changes in directories for your machine.

For the SURF node: In the downloaded repository, open `/vision_tools/src/SURF.cpp` with your favorite text editor. Look for the `path_image` variable assignment inside the main function, change it according to your corresponding path, in my case it is `path_image= "/home/marco/catkin_ws/src/vision_tools/img/cuad2.png";`. The path that you have to write is the path of the sample image that you will search using the SURF algorithm.

For the detect node: open `/vision_tools/src/DetectBall.cpp` and change the ball.cascade path inside the main function, II section. In my case it looks like `if( !ball_cascade.load("/home/marco/catkin_ws/src/vision_tools/cascade/ballDetector.xml" ))`, you have to provide the complete path of the cascade detector trained file that is located in the cloned repository `/vision_tools/cascade/ballDetector.xml`. After these steps, build the packages again and you will be able to use the programs.

#### Using the programs

In order to verify that the installation was successful, run the following command:
```
roscore
cntrl+shift+T
rosrun vision_tools particlefilter
```
Then rosmaster will arise and a screen with your webcam image and the particle filter must appear. If these happens, congratulations, you are now ready to prove each of the algorithms included in this package.
The way to run each of the ROS nodes is described below:

###### Kalman Filter + HAAR/LBP Cascade
```
rosrun vision_tools detect <debugger mode (0/1)> [path to video]
```
###### Kalman Filter + Color Detection
```
rosrun vision_tools kalmanfilter <debugger mode (0/1)> [path to video]
```
###### Particle Filter + Color Detection
```
rosrun vision_tools particlefilter
```
###### SURF
```
rosrun vision_tools SURF
```
###### Dynamixel motors
```
rosrun vision_tools track
```
## 4. Explanation
#### ROS

<img src="read_img/kinetic.png" align="right" width="157" height="130"/>

The [Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://www.ros.org/) is a flexible modular framework for writing robot software. It is a set of open source software libraries and tools that aim to simplify developing robot applications. This ecosystem provides services such as hardware abstraction, low-level device control, package management, communications infrastructure, diagnostics, pose estimation, localization, mapping, navigation, GUI, simulation, computer vision, etc. If you want to know more about using ROS, please check [ROS1 wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS), I highly recommend completing the tutorials.

Due to the amount of packages available, Kinetic Kame [ROS distribution](http://wiki.ros.org/Distributions) is used for this package. However, it is getting older and it will reach its end of life starting 2021, therefore a migration from Kinetic Kame to Melodic Morenia must be sought soon.

#### OpenCV

<img src="read_img/opencv.png" align="right" width="100" height="123"/>

The [Open Source Computer Vision Library](https://opencv.org/) is a set of software functions that provide a common infrastructure for computer vision and machine learning applications with over 2500 optimized algorithms. These algorithms can be used to detect faces, identify objects, track moving objects, image processing, etc. OpenCV3 is the default version for ROS Kinetic and it is linked to ROS in such a way that it is already a system dependency. In order to install this library, check this [repository](https://github.com/aaceves/opencv_tutorial) and [ROS documentation](https://wiki.ros.org/vision_opencv). I attached some links if you want to know more about the different [functions](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/refman.html) available and application [examples and tutorials](https://docs.opencv.org/3.3.1/d9/df8/tutorial_root.html). More tutorials (in spanish) can be found [here](http://acodigo.blogspot.com/p/tutorial-opencv.html).

In order to improve the programs performance, [Open Computer Language (OpenCL)](https://opencv.org/opencl/) acceleration for OpenCV was used, providing some OpenCV algorithms access to the GPU, therefore GPU instead of CPU instructions will be executed automatically if a compatible device is available and makes sense from the performance point of view. OpenCL is compatible with AMD and Intel GPUs.

#### Kalman Filter

<img src="read_img/kf-matlab.png" align="right" width="236" height="134"/>

In simple terms, the Kalman Filter is an observer that estimates the state of a system in the presence of noisy measurements [1]. In more precise terms it is a recursive filter, manifested as a set of mathematical equations that implement a predictor-corrector type estimator that is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the estimated error covariance. This algorithm is commonly used for tracking tasks, motion prediction and multi-sensor fusion. [2] If you are not acquainted with this filter, you can check this [Matlab video series](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/series/understanding-kalman-filters.html) and read [Welch and Bishop introduction](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~welch/media/pdf/kalman_intro.pdf). Also Matlab documentation includes a demonstration of the Kalman Filter for [object tracking with vision](https://www.mathworks.com/help/vision/examples/using-kalman-filter-for-object-tracking.html).

Because of these properties, the Kalman Filter algorithm was implemented in code in order to track the ball and estimate its position, velocity and acceleration. In this package, it was combined with two different detection methods: Color Detector and a Cascade Object Detector. The latest version of the program is the detect node (KF with cascade object detector), which implements some corrections on minor bugs and optimizes the code to increase the performance.
In order to detect and track the soccer ball, a Discrete-Time Linear Gaussian State Space Model of a particle with uniform acceleration was used, since it would detect the change of acceleration due to friction losses and have a better prediction:

Having this model defined, the 5 KF equations were implemented:


#### Particle Filter


#### Cascade Object Detector
